## v0.1
**Purpose:** build the absolute foundation. privately usable by me
**Goal:** auth, routing Save content → auto-classify → store → view in dashboard.

- [ ] Email/password authentication
- [ ] Paste content (URL or notes)
- [ ] Auto-fetch metadata
- [ ] Classification Agent assigns category
- [ ] View saved content in dashboard list
- [ ] Store data in Firestore/Cloud Storage
- [ ] Basic filtering (platform, type, tag)
- [ ] Firestore access rules for user isolation

#### features-to-implement
##### auth
- [ ] Sign up and login with **email/password**
- [ ] Handle **sign-out**
- [ ] Protect all user interactions behind **auth state guard** in frontend
- [ ] Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- [ ] Store `uid` securely client-side for scoped database access
- [ ] Integrate with Firestore Security Rules to validate logged-in identity

##### access
- [ ] Each user has their own Firestore document: `users/{uid}`
- [ ] Store content in user-specific subcollections: `users/{uid}/savedContent`
- [ ] Apply **Firestore Security Rules** to restrict access:
  - [ ] Users can only `read/write` their own `users/{uid}` document
  - [ ] Users can only access `savedContent` and `journals` where `uid == request.auth.uid`
  - [ ] Ensure Cloud Storage access is scoped via Firebase rules (only upload to own bucket folders)

##### content-saving
- [ ] Paste URL from supported platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter/X)
- [ ] Auto-fetch metadata (title, platform, timestamp, etc.)
- [ ] Paste or write plain text (e.g., notes, ideas, quotes)
