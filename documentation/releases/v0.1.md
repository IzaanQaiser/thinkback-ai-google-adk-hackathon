## v0.1
**Purpose:** build the absolute foundation. privately usable by me
**Goal:** auth, routing Save content → auto-classify → store → view in dashboard.

- [ ] Email/password authentication
- [ ] Paste content (URL or notes)
- [ ] Auto-fetch metadata
- [ ] Classification Agent assigns category
- [ ] View saved content in dashboard list
- [ ] Store data in Firestore/Cloud Storage
- [ ] Basic filtering (platform, type, tag)
- [ ] Firestore access rules for user isolation

#### features-to-implement
##### auth
- [ ] Sign up and login with **email/password**
- [ ] Handle **sign-out**
- [ ] Protect all user interactions behind **auth state guard** in frontend
- [ ] Redirect unauthenticated users to login page
- [ ] Store `uid` securely client-side for scoped database access
- [ ] Integrate with Firestore Security Rules to validate logged-in identity

##### access
- [ ] Each user has their own Firestore document: `users/{uid}`
- [ ] Store content in user-specific subcollections: `users/{uid}/savedContent`
- [ ] Apply **Firestore Security Rules** to restrict access:
  - [ ] Users can only `read/write` their own `users/{uid}` document
  - [ ] Users can only access `savedContent` and `journals` where `uid == request.auth.uid`
  - [ ] Ensure Cloud Storage access is scoped via Firebase rules (only upload to own bucket folders)

##### content-saving
- [ ] Paste URL from supported platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter/X)
- [ ] Auto-fetch metadata (title, platform, timestamp, etc.)
- [ ] Paste or write plain text (e.g., notes, ideas, quotes)

##### content-classification
- [ ] Store metadata (platform, link, title, timestamp)
- [ ] Assign main category (e.g., Finance, Wellness, Motivation, Academic)

##### content-storage
- [ ] Save raw user input (URL, text) to Firestore or Cloud Storage (depending on type)
- [ ] Store structured metadata (title, category, platform) in Firestore
- [ ] Ensure all content entries have **creation timestamps**
- [ ] Enable access control (per-user content isolation via UID)

##### content-embedding-and-indexing
- [ ] Store metadata + structured data in Firestore
- [ ] Timestamp each entry (save time only for now)
