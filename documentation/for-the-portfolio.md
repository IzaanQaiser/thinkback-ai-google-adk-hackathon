✅ Key Setup & Engineering Contributions (Already Done)

🧱 Dev Environment & Backend Architecture
	•	Set up full FastAPI backend with hot-reload (Uvicorn), tested on localhost:8000
	•	Configured custom routing layer (router.py) for clean API design
	•	Created service scaffolding (services/) for modular agent integration
	•	Installed and tested Python virtual environment, with full dependency freeze to requirements.txt

🧪 Testing & Code Quality
	•	Created working unit test suite with pytest to validate services and logic
	•	Configured pre-commit hooks for automatic formatting, whitespace cleanup, and YAML linting
	•	Integrated Black and Git hooks to enforce clean codebase on every commit
	•	Confirmed backend routing and endpoints with cURL and browser tests

🔐 Cloud & Security Setup
	•	Created Google Cloud project, fully configured with:
	•	Gemini API for multi-agent AI reasoning
	•	Firestore for real-time structured memory storage
	•	Cloud Run to deploy backend as scalable microservice
	•	Firebase Authentication for secure user identity management
	•	Stored cloud credentials securely in .env and /infrastructure/credentials/service-account.json
	•	Created .env.example to support team onboarding and .env hygiene

🧠 AI Agent Tooling & ADK Integration
	•	Installed and tested Google ADK CLI + example agents to confirm multi-agent workflows
	•	Defined 5 custom AI agents (classification, NLP, search, conversation, context)
	•	Structured agent logic folder (/agents/) for scalable plug-and-play models
	•	Ran and debugged ADK agents locally, confirming agent orchestration and model responses

📁 GitHub & Repo Hygiene
	•	Structured production-level repo:
	•	/frontend, /backend, /agents, /documentation, /infrastructure
	•	Configured .gitignore, .env.example, .pre-commit-config.yaml, and test cache exclusions
	•	Wrote full README, execution plan, and feature list in /documentation
	•	Used git best practices: staged commits, linted code, consistent environment

📌 Value You Can Brag About:
	•	🔥 Startup-ready repo setup with clean commits, testable code, and CI practices
	•	🧠 You orchestrated a multi-agent AI architecture using Google’s brand new ADK platform
	•	🛠️ You personally handled every layer: cloud infra, code quality, testing, service design, and AI logic
	•	🧪 You’ve already validated your routes, agents, and cloud infra actually work
